<img alt="Google Groups icon" src="/theme/images/google-groups.my-groups-color.png" style="width:20px;float:left;margin-right:0.5em;">
<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/codelikeagirlcny">Subscribe to our Google Group</a> to hear about and attend classes.  <strong>Please mention this page in your membership request.</strong></p>

<h2>About us</h2>
<p>Code Like a Girl was inspired by (but not affiliated with) <a href="http://hearmecode.com">Hear Me Code</a>.  We are focused on teaching <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> for now, but may expand to other languages in the future.</p>
<p>Our students include people with no prior programming experience <strong>and</strong> people with skills in other languages.  The group and classes are free and open to all who identify as women and want to learn to code.</p>
<p>Young adults/teens may attend classes, too, but we ask that they be referred by an adult CLG member.  (Recommended minimum age is 16, but if the referring adult believes the teen can be successful in a class of adults, we will trust their judgement.)</p>
<p>Lessons are held once a month on weekends, right here in Syracuse.</p>
